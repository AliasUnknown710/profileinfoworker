## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Use `const` for immutable variables, `let` for mutable ones
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use async/await instead of Promises where possible

#### Example:

```javascript
/**
 * Retrieves user profile information from the database
 * @param {string} userId - The unique user identifier
 * @returns {Promise<Object|null>} User profile object or null if not found
 */
async function getUserProfile(userId) {
  // Implementation here
}
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

#### Types of commits:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run formatting
npm run format
```

### Test Guidelines

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure tests are deterministic and isolated
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Manual Testing

Use the provided `test.html` file to manually test the worker:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open `test.html` in your browser
3. Test various scenarios:
   - Valid authentication
   - Invalid/missing authentication
   - Different endpoints
   - Error conditions
